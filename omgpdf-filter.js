    // We have a similar situation as the decoder, where we want to store
    // variable length entries (code table entries), but we want to do in a
    // faster manner than an array of arrays.  The code below stores sort of a
    // linked list within the code table, and then "chases" through it to
    // construct the dictionary entries.  When a new entry is created, just the
    // last byte is stored, and the rest (prefix) of the entry is only
    // referenced by its table entry.  Then the code chases through the
    // prefixes until it reaches a single byte code.  We have to chase twice,
    // first to compute the length, and then to actually copy the data to the
    // output (backwards, since we know the length).  The alternative would be
    // storing something in an intermediate stack, but that doesn't make any
    // more sense.  I implemented an approach where it also stored the length
    // in the code table, although it's a bit tricky because you run out of
    // bits (12 + 12 + 8), but I didn't measure much improvements (the table
    // entries are generally not the long).  Even when I created benchmarks for
    // very long table entries the complexity did not seem worth it.
